    "You are given a string **s**. Your task is to sort the string according to the following criteria:\n",
    "1. All lowercase letters come before all uppercase letters.\n",
    "2. All uppercase letters come before all digits.\n",
    "3. All digits come before all special characters.\n",
    "4. Within each of the three groups, the elements should be sorted in **lexicographical order** (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format:\n",
    "- A single string **s**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Format:\n",
    "- Print the string **s** after sorting it according to the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "- Sorting the string by custom sort function in the same order as constrains.\n",
